# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Paragraph Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

Most items in a story are paragraphs. Double click a Factory to make a paragraph. Press return (enter) when editing a paragraph to make a new paragraph.
